# Python-File-Organizer
Simple Python Script to help with file organization

Track a directory, and if a new file is added into this directory it will be moved to a directory that you specified.

If the file is some kind of image, it will be mobed to the dir you specified in the 'images' folder, if it is audio it will be movied to 'audio' folder.
etc...

You can play around to split the images into subfolders by date or smth
